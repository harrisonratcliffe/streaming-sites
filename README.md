# Astro

A simple website with a list of streaming websites for movies, TV series and sports.

## Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro`, `.md`, or `.js` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                 | Action                                             |

| `npm run start`        | Starts a production dev server at  `localhost:3000`     |
